experiences:
    - role: Co-Director
      time: 2016 - 2018
      company: Youth Development Organization, Lawrence MA
      details: 
            I started working in the Youth Development Organization as a 
            staff member after being a part of the organization for five years. 
            After two years I was asked to step up and become one of the
            co-directors of the summer program. As the co-director I had to 
            hire 50 staff members annually to instruct a class that I make sure
            is carefully planned out and strategized to meet the children’s needs.
            I had a hand in all aspects of the summer, whether it was ensuring that
            all the staff had done their chores for the day, to producing a unique 
            schedule for every student that was a part of the program. As a director 
            of the Organization I would have to constantly talk to parents and
            hold accountablity for all my staff and students.
