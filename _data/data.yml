    title: About Me
    summary: |
     I come from a Lebanese household that resides in Lawrence Massachusetts. 
     I have been coding my whole life and once I received my Posse Foundation 
     Full-Tuition Leadership Scholarship, I immediately declared for a Bachelor 
     of Science in Computer Science. Since then I have taken rigorous courses involving
     building data structures, understanding the mathematical foundations of computer 
     science and working within computer systems. I hope to graduate and have a career 
     in a company that I can utilize my skillset to not only better myself, but better those around me.

experiences:



    - role: Software Engineer Intern
      time: Summer of 2019
      company: Youth Development Organization, Lawrence MA
      details: |
         Over the summer I worked alongside a software engineer to develop
         a web application to manage student programs, family records, surveys,
         and other information requested by the organization. I was tasked to 
         write scalable code in Python, Javascript, and Ruby, while code reviewing 
         and writing tests. These scripts help sort over 600 student's information 
         to push into our new database. I also built features that used rich analytics
         to measure student success and track progress. I Assisted the SCRUM master and 
         collaborated with stakeholders and designers to deliver our product by
         the required deadline. The finished product can be found [here](https://llama.ydolawrence.org/login).

    - role: Co-Director
      time: 2016 - 2018
      company: Youth Development Organization, Lawrence MA
      details: 
            I started working in the Youth Development Organization as a 
            staff member after being a part of the organization for five years. 
            After two years I was asked to step up and become one of the
            co-directors of the summer program. As the co-director I had to 
            hire 50 staff members annually to instruct a class that I make sure
            is carefully planned out and strategized to meet the childrenâ€™s needs.
            I had a hand in all aspects of the summer, whether it was ensuring that
            all the staff had done their chores for the day, to produce a unique 
            schedule for every student that was a part of the program. As a director 
            of the Organization, I would have to constantly talk to parents and
            hold accountability for all my staff and students. You can read more about my 
            journey with YDO [here](https://www.ydolawrence.org/leadership-staff/171).
         



    - role: Grill Chef
      time: 2016 - Present
      company: Chipotle Mexican Grill
      details: 
          Throughout the years I have been at Chipotle I have had to accurately processed
          an average of 1000 transactions, amounting to about $8000 per day. As the chef, I 
          have to manage the grill and that includes preparing food to quality standards for
          an average of 800 customers daily. When I am not cooking I would provide excellent 
          customer service by speaking to customers, using their feedback to guarantee their
          next visit is met with satisfaction.
